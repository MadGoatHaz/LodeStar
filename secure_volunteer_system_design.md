# Secure Volunteer System Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for a secure, anonymous, and distributed volunteer system for the Lodestar platform. The system will allow volunteers to contribute to the truth-aggregation effort while maintaining their anonymity and ensuring the integrity of collected data.

## Security Requirements

### 1. Anonymity
- **Anonymous Participation**: Volunteers can contribute without revealing their identity
- **No Personal Data Collection**: System does not collect personally identifiable information
- **IP Address Protection**: Volunteer IP addresses are not logged or tracked
- **Browser-Based Contribution**: Volunteers can contribute directly through their web browser

### 2. Data Integrity
- **Multi-Signature Verification**: Data must be verified by at least 3 independent volunteers
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: All data is hashed for integrity verification
- **Distributed Consensus**: Consensus mechanism to validate collected data
- **Tamper-Evident Storage**: Any modification to data is detectable

### 3. System Security
- **Attack Resistance**: System is resilient to coordinated attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse through rate limiting mechanisms
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are thoroughly validated
- **Secure Communication**: All communication is encrypted

## System Architecture

## Anonymous Participation Features

### 1. Browser-Based Contribution
- **Web Worker**: Background data collection in browser
- **No Installation Required**: Pure JavaScript client
- **Automatic Operation**: Client runs automatically when page is open
- **Resource Management**: Client minimizes system resource usage

### 2. Anonymous Identity
- **Temporary IDs**: Volunteers get temporary anonymous IDs
- **No Account Creation**: No need to create accounts or log in

  constructor() {
    this.anonymousId = this.generateAnonymousId();
    this.isRunning = false;
  }
  
  async startCollection() {
    // Start background data collection
    this.isRunning = true;
    this.collectData();
  }
  
  async collectData() {
    // Collect data based on current page content
    const data = this.extractContent();
    if (data) {
      await this.submitData(data);
    }
    
    // Schedule next collection
    if (this.isRunning) {
      setTimeout(() => this.collectData(), 30000); // 30 seconds
    }
  }
  
  async submitData(data) {
    // Sign data and submit anonymously
    const signedData = await this.signData(data);
    await this.anonymousSubmit(signedData);
  }
}
```

### 2. Verification Network
```python
# verification_network.py
class VerificationNetwork:
    def __init__(self):
        self.verifiers = []
        self.submissions = []
        
    def assign_verification(self, submission):
        # Assign submission to multiple verifiers
        selected_verifiers = self.select_diverse_verifiers(3)
        for verifier in selected_verifiers:
            self.send_verification_request(verifier, submission)
            
    def check_consensus(self, submission_id):
        # Check if enough verifications have been received
        verifications = self.get_verifications(submission_id)
        if len(verifications) >= 3:
            return self.calculate_consensus(verifications)
        return None
```

### 3. Anonymous Submission
```python
# anonymous_submission.py
class AnonymousSubmission:
    def __init__(self):
        self.onion_routers = self.get_onion_routers()
        
    def submit_anonymously(self, data):
        # Route submission through onion network
        encrypted_data = self.encrypt_data(data)
        routed_data = self.route_through_onion(encrypted_data)
        return self.final_submit(routed_data)
```
